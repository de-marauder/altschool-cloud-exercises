LINUX Commands

This article showcases 10 Linux commands and their uses

sudo: Sudo is a command used to grant other users root user privileges in a linux system. It is used because most times it is not advisable to have all users having maximum permissions on a linux system. So, with this command they can temporarily get the permissions they require to perform certain tasks.

apt: Apt is linux’s default application manager and is used to install, update, remove and generally manage the applications on a linux system.

grep: This command is used for identifying patterns in files

less: This command is used to display the contents of a file one full screen at a time. The file opens up as a session on the terminal and must exited after use by hitting the ‘q’ key

KILL: This command is used to stop or kill running processes by sending them selected signals. For example you could send the SIGTERM signal to terminate a process by attaching the option ‘9’ to the KILL command.

chown: This command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory on a linux system.

chmod:  This command is used to change the mod bits of a file or directory on a linux system. These mod bits define the permissions required to perform read, write and execute operations on a file.

ssh: This command is used to access a server remotely and peruse or make changes to it. It requires the username of a user on the server, the IP address of the server and user’s password to successfully enter into the server remotely.

rmdir: This command is used to remove empty directories.

ln: This command is used to establish links between files. The links created exist as shortcuts to the original file they were linked to.
